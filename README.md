# DiscordEmbedLinkGenerator
Getting tired of retyping social media links just to embed them, so deceided to make this application to save me some time in the long run. This web app is a straightforward JavaScript utility that takes links from popular social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Pixiv and converts them into embedded content-friendly links by using . This simplifies content viewing within Discord and allows users to preview the linked content without needing to click on the links.
